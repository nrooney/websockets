# Websockets

Messing around with websockets and testing on mobile device. Using Twitter Bootstrap because I like shiny UI. 

Currently using socket.io following tutorial from http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/real-time-chat-with-nodejs-socket-io-and-expressjs/. In past used http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/Real-time-chat-with-NodeJS-Socketio-and-ExpressJS.
